# Rasmus

A colorscheme for vim. This is a vimscript port of the theme [Rasmus](https://github.com/kvrohit/rasmus.nvim").

## Installation

Install the with your preferred package manager:  
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
```
Plug 'ciancallaghan/rasmus.vim'
```

## Usage

Enable the colorscheme:
```
colorscheme rasmus
```

## Issues

Since there are only a limited number of cterm colours it's recommended to set `termguicolors`.  
The theme works without but the colours used are just an approximation. If you have a recommendation as to which colour fits better feel free to let me know.
